## 📈 Conversion Optimization Tips

### 1. **Time-Based Urgency**
- Use short validity periods (1-6 hours) for flash sales
- Set longer periods (24-48 hours) for regular promotions
- Avoid very long periods that reduce urgency

### 2. **Scarcity Management**
- Set realistic usage limits (8-50 coupons)
- Monitor usage and adjust limits dynamically
- Use "Only X left!" messaging for low quantities

### 3. **Social Proof Enhancement**
- Base counts on actual usage data
- Add random variation to appear more natural
- Use specific numbers (not just "many people")

### 4. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Place urgency elements prominently
- Use contrasting colors for important information
- Ensure countdown timer is easily readable

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Countdown Timer
```javascript
// Real-time countdown with automatic updates
useEffect(() => {
  const calculateTimeLeft = () => {
    const now = new Date().getTime();
    const validUntil = new Date(promotionData.valid_until).getTime();
    const difference = validUntil - now;
    // Calculate hours, minutes, seconds
  };
  
  const timer = setInterval(calculateTimeLeft, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(timer);
}, [promotionData]);
```

### Remaining Coupons
```javascript
// Dynamic calculation based on usage
const remainingCoupons = promotionData.usage_limit 
  ? Math.max(0, promotionData.usage_limit - (promotionData.used_count || 0))
  : null;
```

### Urgency Detection
```javascript
// Smart urgency detection
const isUrgent = timeLeft.hours < 24 || (remainingCoupons && remainingCoupons < 10);
```
