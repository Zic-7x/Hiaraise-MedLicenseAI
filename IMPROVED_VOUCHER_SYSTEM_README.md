# ðŸŽ« Improved Voucher System Documentation

## Overview
The voucher system has been significantly improved to support flexible pricing, specific exam authorities, and lifetime validity. This system now handles DHA, MOHAP, DOH, QCHP, and SCFHS exam vouchers with dynamic pricing based on current market rates.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Flexible Pricing Model
- **No Fixed Exam Costs**: The system no longer relies on fixed pricing structures
- **Market-Based Pricing**: Prices are calculated based on current market rates for each exam authority
- **Service Fee Structure**: Clear separation between market price and service fee
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices can vary within a range (e.g., $240-$300 USD) based on market conditions

### 2. Exam Authority Support
The system now supports specific exam authorities:
- **DHA** (Dubai Health Authority) - Typically $240-$300 USD
- **MOHAP** (Ministry of Health UAE) - Typically $240-$280 USD  
- **DOH** (Department of Health Abu Dhabi) - Typically $250-$300 USD
- **QCHP** (Qatar Council for Healthcare) - Typically $280-$350 USD
- **SCFHS** (Saudi Commission) - Typically $300-$350 USD
- **Prometric** (General) - Default pricing

### 3. Lifetime Validity
- **Lifetime Until Slots Expire**: Vouchers remain valid until the slot expires
- **No Fixed Expiration**: Unlike traditional vouchers with fixed dates
- **Slot-Based Expiration**: Validity tied to slot availability rather than arbitrary dates
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Users can book their exam anytime before slot expiration
